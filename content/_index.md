([Fixed in Hugo 0.46](https://gohugo.io/news/0.46-relnotes/))

I should be 16px wide.

I'm not on my first build (`resources/_gen` is empty).

But I am on subsequent builds (`resources/_gen` contains the 16px variant).

```
rm -rf resources/_gen
hugo serve
# See full size image

#Â ctrl+c
hugo serve
# See 16px image
```
